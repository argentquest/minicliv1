# üöÄ Start Commands Launcher

An interactive command launcher for Code Chat AI that helps users choose the right way to start the application with clear categorization and descriptions.

## üìã Overview

## üöÄ Usage

### Option 1: Double-Click Batch File (Easiest - Windows)
Simply **double-click the `start.bat` file** in the project root directory!

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Automatically detects and activates your virtual environment
- ‚úÖ Launches the interactive startcommands launcher
- ‚úÖ Provides clear error messages if something goes wrong
- ‚úÖ Works on any Windows system with Python installed

### Option 2: Interactive Mode (Recommended)

```bash
# Launch interactive launcher
python -m startcommands

# Or run the launcher directly
python startcommands/launcher.py
```

**Note:** The `python -m startcommands` command works because of the `__main__.py` file in the package, which serves as the entry point for module execution.

The interactive launcher will:
1. Show a welcome banner
2. Display available categories
3. Let you browse commands by category
4. Show detailed information about each command
5. Execute your selected command

### Command-Line Mode

```bash
# List all available commands
python -m startcommands --list

# Show commands in specific category
python -m startcommands --category "GUI Applications"

# Run specific command directly
python -m startcommands --run main_gui

# Search commands by keyword
python -m startcommands --search "web"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Commands

1. Edit `startcommands/commands.py`
2. Add new `StartupCommand` instances to the registry
3. Commands are automatically categorized and sorted by priority

Example:
```python
self._register_command(StartupCommand(
    id="my_command",
    name="My Custom Command",
    description="Description of what this command does",
    category="My Category",
    command="my_script.py",
    icon="üéØ",
    priority=5
))
```

### Command Properties

- **id**: Unique identifier for the command
- **name**: Display name shown to users
- **description**: Detailed explanation of the command
- **category**: Category for organization
- **command**: Python script to execute
- **args**: Optional command-line arguments
- **icon**: Emoji icon for visual identification
- **priority**: Sort order within category (higher = first)

## üìã Examples

### Example 1: First-time Setup
```bash
# Launch interactive launcher
python -m startcommands

# Select "GUI Applications" category
# Choose "Main GUI Application"
# Application launches with full interface
```

### Example 2: Web Development
```bash
# Launch web application
python -m startcommands --run web_app

# Or use interactive mode
python -m startcommands
# Select "Web Applications" -> "Web Application (Full)"
```

### Example 3: CLI Automation
```bash
# Run CLI with specific parameters
python -m startcommands --run cli_rich

# Or search for CLI commands
python -m startcommands --search "cli"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
- Check if the command file exists in the project directory
- Verify Python path and working directory
- Use `--list` to see all available commands

### Environment Setup Required
- Run `python -m startcommands setup` (if available)
- Check `.env` file for required variables
- Verify API keys and configuration

### Permission Errors
- Ensure execute permissions on script files
- Check file ownership and access rights
- Try running with appropriate user privileges

## üìù Notes

- GUI applications launch in background and don't block the terminal
- CLI applications run in foreground and return control when complete
- The launcher automatically detects command availability and requirements
- Commands are sorted by priority within each category
- Search is case-insensitive and matches both names and descriptions

## ü§ù Contributing

To add new startup commands:

1. Follow the `StartupCommand` structure in `commands.py`
2. Add appropriate icons and descriptions
3. Test the command execution
4. Update this documentation

The launcher is designed to be extensible and easy to maintain.
